#### Notes
Mathematical Operations on Data
  * Execute Simple calculation e.g. add tow inputs to create a new value.
  * Execute Advanced Calculation e.g. run a matrix calculation for equipment analytics.
Configuration operations on system: inmation
  * Create/Update/Delete objects in all system:inmation model trees.
Both functions to run more complicated tasks.

Scripts are attached to objects that exist in the difference models.
Scripts are hosted by properties of objects.

```
They should clearly and simply articulate on a high level what inmation is and what they do.
```
Software infrastructure... allow you to aggregate... wrap your hardware around the world...
Do big data abalytics around operational assets.
Abstract a way around...

#### Primary Questions
```
Understand why that script needs to be there.
```

#### Secondary Questions
```
How to run an inmation Remote Context Service (together with web service & interface)?
