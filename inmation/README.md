#### Notes

Mathematical Operations on Data
  * Execute Simple calculation e.g. add tow inputs to create a new value.
  * Execute Advanced Calculation e.g. run a matrix calculation for equipment analytics.
  
Configuration operations on system: inmation
  * Create/Update/Delete objects in all system:inmation model trees.

Both functions to run more complicated tasks.

Scripts are attached to objects that exist in the difference models.
Scripts are hosted by properties of objects.

```
They should clearly and simply articulate on a high level what inmation is and what they do.
```
Software infrastructure... allow you to aggregate... wrap your hardware around the world...
Do big data analytics around operational assets.
Abstract a way around...
Unified way to bring data...
Do something intelligent with data in a uniform way. Website that screams value.

#### Questions

Why is default do not persist in persisting mode.

#### Suggestions for Improvement

Default colors shouldnâ€™t be the same in object properties.
There should be a way to close all tabs per window ( e.g. all history trends) at once.
