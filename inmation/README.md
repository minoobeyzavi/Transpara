#### Notes

Mathematical Operations on Data
  * Execute Simple calculation e.g. add tow inputs to create a new value.
  * Execute Advanced Calculation e.g. run a matrix calculation for equipment analytics.
  
Configuration operations on system: inmation
  * Create/Update/Delete objects in all system:inmation model trees.

Both functions to run more complicated tasks.

Scripts are attached to objects that exist in the difference models.
Scripts are hosted by properties of objects.

```
They should clearly and simply articulate on a high level what inmation is and what they do.
```
Software infrastructure... allow you to aggregate... wrap your hardware around the world...
Do big data abalytics around operational assets.
Abstract a way around...
Unified way to bring data...
Do something intelligent with data in a uniform way. Website that screams value.

#### Notes From Stefan

Use the CSV Import Template to conveniently edit the content in Excel.  When done Copy & Paste the content without hte header line (!!) to a csv-txt file. Follow the instructions in the How To for importing.

 

This is V01 and still has room for improvement:

- Lat/Long not used yet

- still only safe to use on a blank system

- Import CSV needs to be ASCII only (no "mÂ³" and the like)

- Manual copy of Excel to CSV required

I can improve this after my vacation, maybe with some fedback of yours, how it worked for you?

@Christian:  I noticed on my testing machine that after some back and forth of creating and deleting the same KPIs multiple times, in some situations the GUIDs were not written from VKPI to the objects on our side, even though they were visible in VKPI.  Did not have the time to check what the reason was.  We need to watch this closely.

#### Key Words

Contextualize, Consolidate, Standardize, Historization, Aggregation, Trends, The Inside API, Simulation

#### Primary Questions
```
Understand why that script needs to be there.
