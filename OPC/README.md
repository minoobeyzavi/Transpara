OPC is a software interface standard that allows Windows programs to communicate with industrial hardware devices.

The acronym "OPC" comes from "OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) for Process Control". Since OLE is based on the Windows COM (Component Object Model) standard, under the hood OPC is essentially COM. Over a network, OPC relies on DCOM (Distributed COM), which was not designed for real-time industrial applications and is often set aside in favour of OPC tunnelling.

OPC actually comprises several standards, the first and most important of which is OPC Data Access (OPC DA). There are also standards for alarms & events, historical data, batch data, and XML.


OPC is the interoperability standard for the secure and reliable exchange of data in the industrial automation space and in other industries. It is platform independent and ensures the seamless flow of information among devices from multiple vendors.
