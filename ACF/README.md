#### Analect Concentration File Format

The difference between the lab results and the online results at the time the sample was taken are the primary performance measurement of the analyzer.  The closer they match, the better.   The lab reference data comes from the site lab information management system (LIMS) - not the analyzer, so would have to be mocked up somehow.
