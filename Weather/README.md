I talked to them yesterday about creating a bundled and discounted subscription specifically for our data needs and they just got back to me with two quotes. They have two APIs for historical data with daily and hourly frequency and expanding to 1937; a standard data-base with gaps in data availability and a cleaned version. The specifications I provided for quoting purposes:

1,000,000  total calls per month includes 100,000 calls for historical data for only the past 5 years with hourly frequency.

FoD + CoD + Historical(Cleaned)  = $2,200 before discounting. 
Bundled Discount Total: $1980/month

FoD + CoD + Historical(Station-Based) = $1,900 before discounting.  
Bundle Discount Total: $1710/month

One-time pull in .csv format was about $100,000. They provided other pricing options as well (such as $700/month for 5000 calls/day to their cleaned historical data) and a free trial. Attached are their API documentation with the explanation of the gap-filling technique.
